To test your network, train it to distinguish the classes of versicolor and virginica in the Iris dataset using only the third and fourth features (i.e., petal length and petal width) as the inputs. As usual, use 70% of the data for training and the rest for testing. Repeat the experiments 10 times to find the average accuracy. During training, set the desired output as 1.0 for in class data and 0.0 for out of class data. Don’t forget to use random numbers as the initial weights. In addition, monitor the cost (loss) function with respect to the training epochs. Do you observe any difference when compared with the cost function plot using MSE?**"
